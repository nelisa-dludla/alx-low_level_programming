# C - malloc, free

In this project, I was looking at the following functions:

- malloc
- free

## Tasks

```C
0-create_array.c - a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char

1-args.c - a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter

2-str_concat.c - a function that concatenates two strings

3-alloc_grid.c - a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers

4-free_grid.c - a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function
```

## Advanced Tasks

```C
100-argstostr.c - a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program
```

## Requirements

## C
- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc and free. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use _putchar
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`
