# C - More pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Data Stuctures

## Tasks

```C
0-strcat.c - is a function that concatenates two strings

1-strncat.c - is a function that concatenates two strings

2-strncpy.c - is a function that copies a string

3-strcmp.c - is a function that compares two strings

4-rev_array.c - is a function that reverses the content of an array of integers

5-string_toupper.c - is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

6-cap_string.c - is a function that capitalizes all words of a string

7-leet.c - is a function that encodes a string into 1337
```
## Requirements

- Allowed editors: ```vi, vim, emacs```
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ```gcc```, using the options ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
- All files should end with a new line
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like ```printf, puts,``` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- The ```main.c``` files can be used to test the functions
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function ```_putchar``` are included in the header file called ```main.h```
