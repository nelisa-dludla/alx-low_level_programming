# C - More pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Data Stuctures

## Requirements

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

- `0-strcat.c` - is a function that concatenates two strings
- `1-strncat.c` - is a function that concatenates two strings
- `2-strncpy.c` - is a function that copies a string
- `3-strcmp.c` - is a function that compares two strings
- `4-rev_array.c` - is a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
- `5-string_toupper.c` - is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
- `6-cap_string.c` - is a function that capitalizes all words of a string
- `7-leet.c` - is a function that encodes a string into 1337
