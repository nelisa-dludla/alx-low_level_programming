# C - Singly linked lists

In this project, I looked at the following concept:

- Data Structures (Linked lists)

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Use of global variables was not allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Authorized functions and marcos are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- The `main.c` files were used to test the functions
- The prototypes of all functions are included in the header file called `lists.h`
- Header file is include guarded

## Tasks

- `0-print_list.c` - a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list
- `1-list_len.c` - a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list
- `2-add_node.c` - a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list
- `3-add_node_end.c` - a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list
- `4-free_list.c` - a function that frees a `list_t` list
