# C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I looked at the following concepts:

- Functions
- Nested loops

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

- `0-putchar.c` - A program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line
- `1-alphabet.c` - A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` - A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- `3-islower.c` - A function that checks for lowercase character
- `4-isalpha.c` - A function that checks for alphabetic character
- `5-sign.c` - A function that prints the sign of a number
- `6-abs.c` - A function that computes the absolute value of an integer
- `7-print_last_digit.c` - A function that prints the last digit of a number
- `8-24_hours.c` - A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59
- `9-times_table.c` - A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
- `10-add.c` - A function that adds two integers and returns the result
- `11-print_to_98.c` - A function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line
