# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I looked at the following concepts:

- Variables
- if, else, while statements

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files end with a new line
- Not allowed to use `system`
- Code follows the `Betty` style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

## Tasks

- `0-positive_or_negative.c` - Program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed
- `1-last_digit.c` - Program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed
- `2-print_alphabet.c` - Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
- `3-print_alphabets.c` - Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
- `4-print_alphabt.c` - Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
- `5-print_numbers.c` - Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line
- `6-print_numberz.c` - Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line
- `7-print_tebahpla.c` - Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line
- `8-print_base16.c` - Program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line
- `9-print_comb.c` - Program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
- `100-print_comb3.c` - Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits
- `101-print_comb4.c` - Program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits
- `102-print_comb5.c` - Program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers
