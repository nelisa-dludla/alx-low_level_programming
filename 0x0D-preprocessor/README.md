# C - Preprocessor

In this project, I was looking at the following topic:

- Preprocessor

## Tasks

```C
0-object_like_macro.h - a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024

1-pi.h - a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359

2-main.c - a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line

3-function_like_macro.h - a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x

4-sum.h - a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
```

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use _putchar
- All your header files should be include guarded
