# C - Hello, World

In this project, I looked at the following concept:

- C Programming

## Info

### C

- Files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Not allowed to use `system`
- Code follows the `Betty` style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

### Shell Scripts

- All scripts were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts are exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/bin/bash`

## Tasks

- `0-preprocessor` - a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
- `1-compiler` - a script that compiles a C file but does not link
- `2-assembler` - a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file
- `3-name` - a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`
- `4-puts.c` - a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line
- `5-printf.c` - a C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line
- `6-size.c` - a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
- `100-intel` - a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file
- `101-quote.c` - a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error
