# C - Structures, typedef

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Structures
- typdef

## Tasks

```C
dog.h - define a new type struct dog with the following elements

1-init_dog.c - a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog

2-print_dog.c - a function that prints a struct dog

dog.h - define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog

4-new_dog.c - a function that creates a new dog

5-free_dog.c - a function that frees dogs
```

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `printf`, `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. (Unless otherwise stated)
- All your header files should be include guarded
