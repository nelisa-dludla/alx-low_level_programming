# C - Structures, typedef

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Structures
- typdef

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `printf`, `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. (Unless otherwise stated)
- Header file is include guarded

## Tasks

- `dog.h` - define a new type struct dog
- `1-init_dog.c` - a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog
- `2-print_dog.c` - a function that prints a struct dog
- `dog.h` - define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog
- `4-new_dog.c` - a function that creates a new dog
- `5-free_dog.c` - a function that frees dogs
