# C - Function pointers

In this project, I was looking at the following concept:

- Function pointers

## Tasks

```C
0-print_name.c - a function that prints a name

1-array_iterator.c - a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array

2-int_index.c - a function that searches for an integer

3-calc.h - contains all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program

3-get_op_func.c - contains the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user

3-main.c - contains main function only
```

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `print`f, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function`_putchar` should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h`
- All your header files should be include guarded
