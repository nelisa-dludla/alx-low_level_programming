**In this directory, you will find all the C programs I have created for my C Projects:**

1. main.h - Header file

2. 0-main.c - a test for a postitive_or_negative() function, similar to the one I've worked on in an earlier C project

3. 1-main.c - I had to comment out (not delete) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop

4. 2-largest_number.c - I had to fix the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case

5. 3-print_remaining_days.c - I had to fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
