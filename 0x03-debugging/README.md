# C - Debugging

In this project, I looked at the following topic:

- Debugging

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

## Tasks

- `0-main.c` - I was not allowed to add or remove lines of code, I could only change one line of code to get it to work
- `1-main.c` - I had to comment out (not delete) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop
- `2-largest_number.c` - I had to fix the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case
- `3-print_remaining_days.c` - I had to fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
