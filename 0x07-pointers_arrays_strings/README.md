# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Data Stuctures

## Tasks

```C
0-memset.c - is a function that fills memory with a constant byte

1-memcpy.c - is a function that copies memory area

2-strchr.c - is a function that locates a character in a string

3-strspn.c - is a function that gets the length of a prefix substring

4-strpbrk.c - is a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes

5-strstr.c - is a function that locates a substring

7-print_chessboard.c - is a function that prints the chessboard

8-print_diagsums.c - is a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
```

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- The `main.c` files can be used to test the functions
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`
