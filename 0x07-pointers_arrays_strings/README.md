# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Data Stuctures

## Requirements

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

- `0-memset.c` - is a function that fills memory with a constant byte
- `1-memcpy.c` - is a function that copies memory area
- `2-strchr.c` - is a function that locates a character in a string
- `3-strspn.c` - is a function that gets the length of a prefix substring
- `4-strpbrk.c` - is a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes
- `5-strstr.c` - is a function that locates a substring
- `7-print_chessboard.c` - is a function that prints the chessboard
- `8-print_diagsums.c` - is a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
