# C - More functions, nested loops

In this project, I looked at the following concepts:

- Functions
- Nested loops

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

- `0-isupper.c` - Function that checks for uppercase character
- `1-isdigit.c` - Function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`)
- `2-mul.c` - Function that multiplies two integers
- `3-print_numbers.c` - Function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line
- `4-print_most_numbers.c` - Function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line
- `5-more_numbers.c` - Function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line
- `6-print_line.c` - Function that draws a straight line in the terminal
- `7-print_diagonal.c` - Function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal
- `8-print_square.c` - Function that prints a square, followed by a new line
- `9-fizz_buzz.c` - Program prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`
- `10-print_triangle.c` - Function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line
