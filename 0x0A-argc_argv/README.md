# C - argc, argv

In this project, I was looking at the following functions:

- argc
- argv

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`
- Allowed to use the standard library

## Tasks

- `0-whatsmyname.c` - a program that prints its name, followed by a new line
- `1-args.c` - a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
- `2-args.c` - a program that prints all arguments it receives
- `3-mul.c` - a program that multiplies two numbers
- `4-add.c` - a program that adds positive numbers
