# C - More singly linked lists

In this project, I looked at the following concept:

- Data Structures (Linked lists)

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Use of global variables was not allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Authorized functions and marcos are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- The `main.c` files were used to test the functions
- The prototypes of all functions are included in the header file called `lists.h`
- Header file is include guarded

## Tasks

1. File: `0-print_listint.c` - a function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list

2. File: `1-listint_len.c` - a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list

3. File: `2-add_nodeint.c` - a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list

4. File: `3-add_nodeint_end.c` - a function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list

5. File: `4-free_listint.c` - a function that frees a `listint_t` list

6. File: `5-free_listint2.c` - a function that frees a `listint_t` list

7. File: `6-pop_listint.c` - a function that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` linked list, and returns the head node’s data (n)

8. File: `7-get_nodeint.c` - a function that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` linked list

9. File: `8-sum_listint.c` - a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `listint_t` linked list

10. File: `9-insert_nodeint.c` - a function that inserts a new node at a given position

11. File: `10-delete_nodeint.c` - a function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `listint_t` linked list
