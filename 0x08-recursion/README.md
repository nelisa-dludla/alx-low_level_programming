# C - Recursion

In this project, I was looking at the following concept:

- Recursion

## Tasks

```C
0-puts_recursion.c - is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line

1-print_rev_recursion.c - is a function that prints a string in reverse

2-strlen_recursion.c - is a function that returns the length of a string

3-factorial.c - is a function that returns the factorial of a given number

4-pow_recursion.c - is a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y

5-sqrt_recursion.c - is a function that returns the natural square root of a number

6-is_prime_number.c - is a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0
```

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- The `main.c` files can be used to test the functions
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`
- Not allowed to use any kind of loops
- Not allowed to use static variables
