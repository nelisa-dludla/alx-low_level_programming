# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Data Stuctures

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- `main.c` files were used to test the code
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

- `0-reset_to_98.c` - is a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to, to 98
- `1-swap.c` - is a function that swaps the values of two integers
- `2-strlen.c` - is a function that returns the length of a string
- `3-puts.c` - is a function that prints a string
- `4-print_rev.c` - is a function that prints a string, in reverse
- `5-rev_string.c` - is a function that reverses a string
- `6-puts2.c` - is a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character
- `7-puts_half.c` - is a function that prints the second half of a string
- `8-print_array.c` - is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers
- `9-strcpy.c` - is a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`
