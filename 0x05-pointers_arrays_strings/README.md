# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I was looking at the following concepts:

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Data Stuctures

## Tasks

````C
0-reset_to_98.c - is a function that takes a pointer to an ```int``` as parameter and updates the value it points to, to 98

1-swap.c - is a function that swaps the values of two integers

2-strlen.c - is a function that returns the length of a string

3-puts.c - is a function that prints a string

4-print_rev.c - is a function that prints a string, in reverse

5-rev_string.c - is a function that reverses a string

6-puts2.c - is a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character

7-puts_half.c - is a function that prints the second half of a string

8-print_array.c - is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers

9-strcpy.c - is a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf, puts,` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- The `main.c` files can be used to test the functions
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`
