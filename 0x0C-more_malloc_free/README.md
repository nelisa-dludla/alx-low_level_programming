# C - malloc, free

In this project, I was looking at the following functions:

- malloc
- free
- exit

## Tasks

```C
0-malloc_checked.c - a function that allocates memory using malloc

1-string_nconcat.c - a function that concatenates two strings

2-calloc.c - a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc

3-array_range.c - a function that creates an array of integers
```

## Requirements

## C

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed to use _putchar
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`
