# C - Bit manipulation

In this project, I looked at the following concept:

- Bit manipulation

## Info

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows the Betty style. It was checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Use of global variables was not allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Authorized functions and marcos are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden (Unless otherwise stated)
- Allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- The `main.c` files were used to test the functions
- The prototypes of all functions are included in the header file called `main.h`
- Header file is include guarded

## Tasks

- `0-binary_to_uint.c` - a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`
- `1-print_binary.c` - a function that prints the binary representation of a number
- `2-get_bit.c` - a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
- `3-set_bit.c` - a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index
- `4-clear_bit.c` - a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index
- `5-flip_bits.c` - a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
