# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This repository contains solutions to various bit manipulation problems in C programming. Each solution demonstrates how to perform different bit manipulation operations such as printing binary representation, getting the value of a bit at a given index, setting a bit to 1, and clearing a bit to 0.

## Solutions

### 1. Printing Binary Representation

File: `1-print_binary.c`

This solution provides a function to print the binary representation of an unsigned long integer. It demonstrates how to iterate through the bits of a number and use bitwise operations to extract and print each bit.

### 2. Getting the Value of a Bit at a Given Index

File: `2-get_bit.c`

This solution includes a function to get the value of a specific bit at a given index. It uses bitwise AND operation to check the value of the bit at the specified index.

### 3. Setting a Bit to 1 at a Given Index

File: `3-set_bit.c`

Here, a function is provided that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. It uses bitwise OR operation to achieve this while maintaining other bits unchanged.

### 4. Clearing a Bit to 0 at a Given Index

File: `4-clear_bit.c`

This solution includes a function to clear the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. It employs bitwise AND operation and bitwise NOT to achieve the desired result.

## Notes

These solutions are provided for educational purposes and serve as examples of bit manipulation techniques in C programming.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding of bitwise operations and bit manipulation in C.
